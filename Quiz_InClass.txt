Question #1: Conver decimal to binary (15 pts)

Decimal:            Binary:
5.75                0101.1100

63/64 = 0.984375    0.111111

9.8125              1001.1101

Question #2: Convert the 34.890625 into the IEEE 754 floating-point representation (15 pts)

Decimal:        Binary:                 Explanation:
34.890625       100010.111001           - convert decimal to binary form
                1.00010 111001 x 2^5    - move the Decimal
                00010111001 x 2^5       - drop leading 1
                00010111001000000000000 - add zeroes to make 23 bits in total

Question #3: The following number is the IEEE 754 floating-point representation. Convert the binary number to the decimal number(15 pts)


Step 1: convert binary to decimal exponent

01111011  --> -4

Step 2: Find value of mantissa

all 0 to mantissa is just 0


Result: 

1.0 x 2 ^ -4

Question #4: Explain the definition of denormalized number and show the largest denormalized number and the smallest normalized number(for the positive numbers). 15 pts

Answer:

denormalized number gives way for us to represent floating-point value zero. Additionally, it allows us to 
represent small number that cannot be represent using normalized number.
